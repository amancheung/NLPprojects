Program created with Python that uses data generated from WSJ_02-21.pos-chunk file, which annotates each word by its position in a noun group, and tags words from a new file, e.g. WSJ_24 by their positions in a noun group.

This program has an accuracy of over 95% for correct tags in both the development and test corpus, and F-measures of over 90%.

To run the initial program that generates features for each word token, type the following in command line:

- Create training file
python wordsFeatureTag.py WSJ_02-21.pos-chunk training.feature training 
			   [filename]        [feature-file name] [format command]
- Create testing file
python wordsFeatureTag.py WSJ_24.pos test.feature test
			 [filename] [feature-file [format command]
					name]

Within the program I have implemented the following features:
1) Current word
2) Current POS
3) Previous word
4) Previous POS
5) Previous two word
6) Previous two word POS
7) Next word
8) Next word POS
5) Word stem
6) If word is capitalized
7) If word is sentence beginning
8) If word is sentence end
9) Prev BIO
10) BIO - *training
