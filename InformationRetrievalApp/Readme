Program created with python that compares queries against abstracts, and rank abstracts for each query base on their similarity.
This program created outputs with Average MAP score of .31, which is higher than the .20 average.

To run the program on command line.

Type python lyc286_info_retrieve.py

*Make sure all files are in the same directory
*Make sure that the file "numAbsWordsDocs.txt" is in the same directory, as it is used to look up word frequencies for the abstracts
 - However, I have also commented out the code inside the program that reproduces the same data
 
 List of queries are saved in cran.qry, list of abstracts are saved in cran.all.1400
